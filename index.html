    <h1>King Cobruh</h1>
    <!--<h2>R&D</h2>-->
    <p><em>Founder of <strong>DataonDavis</strong></em></p>
    <p>As we make more advances in creating innovative technology to provide a better quality of life, it's becoming inherently more invasive. The technology we use can be both empowering and detrimental, and if misconfigured, can bolster the rate of success of cyber-criminals by providing additional attack vectors. As a junior security enthusiast, I'm driven to make my mark in the Cyber-Security Industry by shifting the security mindset from tack-on solutions to continuous integration to help combat the growing prevalence of ransomware attacks to our critical infrastructure and other critical sectors like the medical industry. If you support my cause, connect with me, and join me in this journey in tackling this burgeoning concern of security consciousness/awareness.
